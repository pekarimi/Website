          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Designers often experience design fixation - the inability to move beyond their first ideas when sketching. 
            This mental block prevents designers from exploring the full creative space and limits innovative solutions. 
            Traditional design tools provide limited support for breaking out of fixation patterns, particularly during 
            the critical conceptual design phase where creativity is most essential.

              <h2>Research Approach</h2>
              <p>
                I developed the Creative Sketching Partner (CSP), an AI-powered co-creative system that collaborates 
                with designers in real-time during sketching tasks. The system uses deep learning models trained on 
                the QuickDraw! dataset (345 categories, 50+ million sketches) to provide inspirational sketches based 
                on controllable visual and conceptual similarity measures.
              </p>

              <div className="system-overview-section">
                <h3>System Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                  The CSP system operates through two main AI components: a CNN-LSTM architecture for visual similarity 
                  mapping and a word embedding model for conceptual similarity. Users can control the degree of both 
                  visual and conceptual similarity through interactive sliders, enabling them to receive inspirational 
                  sketches that range from structurally similar to conceptually related objects from different categories.

                <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
                <p>
                  The interface facilitates turn-taking between the user and AI agent. Designers work on their sketch 
                  in the left panel, adjust similarity preferences via sliders, and request inspiration from the system. 
                  The AI responds with a labeled sketch from a different category in the right panel, enabling users to 
                  incorporate new ideas through visual and conceptual connections.

                <p>
                  Through retrospective interviews and thematic analysis, I identified three major themes describing 
                  how the CSP system supported the design process:
                </p>
                
                <div className="theme-cards">
                  <div className="theme-card">
                    <Lightbulb className="theme-icon" size={32} />
                    <h4>Design Ideation Support</h4>
                    <p>
                      "It did inspire me. Especially if I was working on a project I think that would really help. 
                      Most likely the initial parts of the design." - P45
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The CSP proved particularly valuable during early design stages, helping participants overcome 
                      blank page syndrome and rapidly generate multiple design iterations.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <Target className="theme-icon" size={32} />
                    <h4>Fixation Breaking</h4>
                    <p>
                      "I think the conceptual one was more inspiring to me personally... With the conceptual one I 
                      could re-interpret it in any way I wanted to." - P39
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Conceptual similarity helped users connect disparate ideas and reinterpret their designs in 
                      new domains, successfully breaking design fixation patterns.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <Palette className="theme-icon" size={32} />
                    <h4>Variable Similarity Benefits</h4>
                    <p>
                      "I think low similarity is more inspiring. Because part of it is art and art is not about making 
                      things exactly like each other but it's about having things or shapes in unexpected places." - P26
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      64% of participants found low similarity more inspiring for creative exploration, while high 
                      similarity helped with design refinement and detail addition.

                    Established empirical evidence that controllable AI similarity measures can systematically influence 
                    different types of design creativity, providing a framework for designing AI creative partners.

              <p>
                This research opens several avenues for future investigation in human-AI co-creativity. Future work 
                should explore the long-term effects of AI collaboration on designers' creative processes, investigate 
                optimal timing for AI intervention during design sessions, and develop personalized similarity measures 
                that adapt to individual designers' creative preferences and expertise levels.
