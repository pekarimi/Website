                Traditional personas focus on WHO users are (demographics, backgrounds), but this approach

                We needed a more dynamic approach that could capture how students actually think and behave

                  This mindset reflects learners who must balance competing priorities and frequently interrupted

                The complexity of student experiences demonstrates why uniform approaches to education 
                technology often fall short of meeting diverse needs.
